save_images_ondoklassniki
=========================

A ruby + watir-webdriver script that will save all images from any given album from ondoklassniki.ru

Instructions: Make sure your ruby version is =< 2.0
Install "watir-webdriver", "open-uri" and  "watir-webdriver/wait"

Steps:

1. Fork or clone the repo.

2. Replace lines: 9 and 10 with your credentials.

3. Input the album URL into brackets from line 17

4. Run 'ruby save_images_ondoklassniki.rb'

All images are saved into newly generated dirrectory which matches the album name.
After the script finishes running open your folder full with all your graphic files. Now you're good to go :)


P.S.> Feel free to play with it, and send me a pull request if implemented something new && util xD
